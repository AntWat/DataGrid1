# DataGrid1 - Implementation of a scrolling data table in Kotlin

This project demonstrates how to implement a data table that scrolls in two directions, with fixed column headers and fixed row headers.
The table is hosted in a fragment, and uses template cells for flexibility.  This is demonstrated by the display of icons in some cells.
This is done without the need to hardcode the creation of individual items in a cell.

The approach could be extended to display any number of graphic items in a cells.
The table also shows how to shows borders around the cells.
